# AuditInsight Bot

AuditInsight Bot is a NumInformatics 10-K Analyzer Chatbot designed to assist users in generating accurate and relevant answers based on audit reports of companies. By leveraging similarity search through documents, the chatbot aims to provide reliable information and insights, ensuring users have access to the data they need.

## Motive
The motive of AuditInsight Bot is to provide users with an efficient tool for analyzing 10-K audit reports and generating insightful answers to their queries.

## Version
1.2.0

## Features
- Analyze user queries based on the top two similarity searches through audit documents.
- Utilize Graph RAG (Retrieve and Generate) to search through the vast and complex audit dataset.
- Implement OpenAI embeddings and Neo4j database for advanced data processing.
- Provide evidence with each generated answer to ensure transparency and reliability.
- Return a clear message when information is not available.

## How It Works
1. **Understand the Context:**
   - Analyze the chat history consisting of queries from the `user` and responses generated by `ai` (the chatbot).
   - Evaluate the current query from the `user`.

2. **Analyze the Records:**
   - The chatbot is provided with two similar records that match the query. Each record consists of:
     - **Company:** The company being audited.
     - **Auditor Company:** The company conducting the audit.
     - **Report Name:** The name of the audit report.
     - **Report Text:** The audit report generated by the `Auditor` on the `Company`.

3. **Generate an Answer:**
   - Use the information in the records to generate an answer to the user's query.
   - If the records do not contain the solution or relevant information related to the query, respond with: "I cannot answer due to lack of evidence." Do not hallucinate or provide irrelevant information.
   - Provide evidence with each answer to ensure the user understands the basis of the response.

## Technologies Used
- **Graph RAG (Retrieve and Generate):** For searching through the vast and complex audit dataset.
- **OpenAI Embeddings:** For advanced data processing and similarity search.
- **Neo4j Database:** For efficient and structured data storage and retrieval.
